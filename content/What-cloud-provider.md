# ‚òÅÔ∏è What cloud provider to choose

There are lots of cloud providers to choose from. Most of them provide attractive offers for new users. We will focus on 2 of them today: [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](http://console.cloud.google.com/).

# **AWS vs GCP**

They are quite different yet both posess all the necessary stuff we may need.

| [**AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com/) | [**GCP**](http://console.cloud.google.com/) |
| --- | --- |
| [1 year free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) | [3 months free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)¬†+¬†300$ for paid services |
| zone doesn‚Äôt matter | only some zones can be chosen in free tier |
| 1 core machine on free tier (t2 micro or t3 micro) | 0.25 core machine on free tier ‚Äî shared core (e2-micro) |
| up to 30 GB disk size on free tier | 10 GB disk size on free tier |
| 5 GB storage | 5 GB storage |
| 1 million requests on Lambda (works with code), free after trial | 2 million requests on Cloud Run (works with containers) |
| convenient user interface | hard to find what you want |
| needs your bank card verification, starts taking money after 1 year trial or if excess free tier limits | needs your bank card verification, after 3 months turns your services off and asks for upgrade to paid version |
| [Container registry ‚Äî 500 MB / month in free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/) | [Pay for storage](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/pricing), but can be covered by credits |
| [Free tier description](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) | [Free tier description](https://cloud.google.com/free) |

For me, these are the main differences that play a big role. 

Both of them allow to register many accounts to continue using free version longer. Both of them have nearly the same pricing after the free version stops: some services are slightly cheaper in one, some in another. 

Decide for yourself, check both out and figure what suits your needs best!
