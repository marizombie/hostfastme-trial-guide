# ⌛️ Next parts

At this point we have set up a virtual machine as a remote server, but we still have to deploy our project, launch a webserver, attach domain, set up DNS and learn a lot.

If you want to host next project at any time for 0 $, go to https://hostfast.me and check out full basic or extended guide!

Let’s meet again and continue our setup! 

# P.S.

If there is something you think should be corrected to make [HostFastMe](https://hostfast.me) guides better or allow you to look forward to next products, please send an email to [maryna@hostfast.me](mailto:maryna@hostfast.me) with subject starting from “**Note**”.

Thank you for the most valuable asset you can give — your attention, I appreciate it.
