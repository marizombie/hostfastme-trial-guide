# üìô AWS setup

# Renting a virtual machine

Go to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) and create a free account.

![aws_main.png](AWS-setup/aws_main.png)

Fill in all data. You‚Äôll need a bank card and mobile phone number to verify account

![aws_signup.png](AWS-setup/aws_signup.png)

Then go to AWS Management Console.

From here we go to EC2 Dashboard:

Then go to Launch instance

*It will tell that instance will be launched in a chosen zone. Zone has not much of a difference, especially on free tier, but you can choose it on top right.*

Name your instance and choose OS, we‚Äôll go with Ubuntu here.

![vm_creation_2.png](AWS-setup/vm_creation_2.png)

Under it, near Key pair¬†click ‚ÄúCreate new key pair‚Äù ‚Äî you‚Äôll use it to connect to machine from yours. I choose ED25519 algorithm.

*In network settings ideally we have to change SSH traffic from anywhere to our IP (DON‚ÄôT FORGET TO TURN OFF VPN), but it will require additional setup when configuring deployment, so we‚Äôll skip it for now)*

Also, as we are setting up a webservice, tick https & http traffic options.

Now to storage

Free tier claims to work with up to 30 gb, let‚Äôs do this!

After this step (and making sure nothing is missed) click ‚ÄúLaunch instance‚Äù.

![aws_launching_instance.png](AWS-setup/aws_launching_instance.png)

It won‚Äôt take long.

You‚Äôll see green success indicator and after this you may go to see your instance via ‚ÄúView all instances‚Äù on the bottom right

![aws_view_all_instances.png](AWS-setup/aws_view_all_instances.png)

After this you are able to connect to it via your key, saved during configuration steps, congrats!

# Connecting to our virtual machine

We can connect to our machine from browser via AWS. You may try it by selecting your machine, going to Actions ‚Üí Connect.

However, I would recommend using local console more as more flexible and convenient tool.

To do that, from your local unix console change the permissions for downloaded key:

`chmod 400 keyname`

After this use ssh connect command using our key:

`ssh -i path-to-key ubuntu@your-machine-public-ip` where ubuntu is the default user on AWS machine with Ubuntu OS, and your-machine-public-ip can be found in AWS Console Instances page near our newly created one.

And you are in!

If something is not working, verify your key placement, double check IP and instruction steps.

You may also check security permissions in Security groups from the left menu, under the Network & Security

![aws_security_menu.png](AWS-setup/aws_security_menu.png)

But if you followed all steps, we haven‚Äôt restricted the access yet.

You may also let your machine some time to initialize properly ‚òï. Once you are in, let‚Äôs continue!
